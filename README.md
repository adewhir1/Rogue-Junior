# Rogue-Junior
Source code for a short roguelike adventure game. Tested on Windows 8.

**********************************************************************

I created this project in 2015 as a relatively new programmer. Reviewing the code after 2 years' hiatus (and 2 years' more experience), I would do several things differently.

This project is abandoned. Roguelikes are overdone, and this code needs to be revised as it is, on top of expanding it to a full game. I would contribute to existing open source roguelikes before further reinventing the wheel with this one. I don't regret making this- of all the programs I've written, no single project has taught me as much as this one did- but it's time to move on.

You can play the game by going to the "releases" tab and downloading RogueJunior.exe (for Windows only). I hope you have a chance to play and get a few minutes of amusement.
